# Audio-Book
This project will be helpful in reading the pdfs of anything as per the users interest.

It's very simple to use and impliment using Flask and Python. If you should have basic knowledge of Flask and Python you can understand the code and costomize it by own.
We searched alot for this type of api but got nothing. Then we decided to work on it and finally we have done it.


Here is a good reference where we copied the web page style and flask template: [Click here](https://dev.to/siddheshshankar/build-a-text-to-speech-service-with-python-flask-framework-3966)

The above link will help you alot for this API.
I have used the same code but customize it to read the text of given PDF file path.

If you wanna change anything in this, write in comment section or clone it and do some fun on it.

 ## What you have to do after cloning it in your system? 

1. Open the downloaded directory (AudioBook) in PyCharm
2. Run the app.py and after some second you will get a link like this http://127.0.0.1:8000/
3. Enter page number (Starting and End, both are optional)
4. Click on the link and then Enter the PDF file path and select the voice (Male/Female)
5. Click on (Listen Text...) button and here you go.

# Issues
We are working to solve issue for page number. For simple pdf it works fine but have some issues in pdf contain images or tabular form.
